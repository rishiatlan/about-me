## The problem

Most organizations now monitor models, versions, and tokens, but the prompt layer is still unmanaged text. That means no clear answer to basic governance questions: who changed this instruction, what risk did it introduce, and can the behavior be reproduced later?

## What I built

Prompt Control Plane is a deterministic governance layer for prompts. It adds structure before execution: risk scoring, policy enforcement, cross-provider routing, and a tamper-evident audit trail. It ships in three useful surfaces at once:

- an MCP server for AI-native workflows
- a CLI for local and CI usage
- a GitHub Action for pull-request quality gates

## Why it matters

The differentiator is that the engine itself does not call an LLM. It enforces rules, structure, and repeatability around the prompt surface, which keeps the system deterministic, cheaper to run, and easier to reason about in production.
