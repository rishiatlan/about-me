## The problem

Important work gets buried under message volume. Slack, Gmail, and calendar invites act like three separate inboxes. Triage is a daily tax.

## What I built

The system reads across all three sources, classifies work by urgency and action type, drafts responses where useful, and keeps a ledger of what is still open versus resolved.

Runs on scheduled automations. Maintains durable state between runs — it knows what was flagged yesterday and whether it was closed. Morning briefings surface the P0 items before the day starts.

## Why a ledger matters

Most triage agents produce summaries. Summaries are disposable — you read them once and the context is gone. A ledger persists. It tracks items to resolution and creates accountability.
