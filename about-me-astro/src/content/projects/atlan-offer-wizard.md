## The problem

Most companies handle the offer stage with flat PDFs and generic email templates. It is one of the highest-leverage moments in hiring — the candidate is deciding — and we were treating it like admin.

## What I built

The system triggers from ATS state in Ashby, pulls interview and offer context, and generates a personalized page structured as a three-act story:

- who the candidate is and what stood out
- why they belong at Atlan specifically
- the offer, presented with context

Recruiters get a shareable link instead of a copy-paste email. Each page costs roughly $0.006 to generate. Runs on Cloudflare Workers + Hono.

## How it changed things

Candidates started screenshotting their offer pages and sharing them. The team stopped writing offer emails from scratch. The cost is negligible and the generation is automatic once the ATS state changes.
