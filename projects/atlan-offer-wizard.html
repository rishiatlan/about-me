      <h2>The problem</h2>
      <p>The offer stage is the highest-stakes moment in the hiring funnel — and most companies treat it like an afterthought. A PDF attachment, a plain-text email, maybe a generic congratulations message. Nothing that makes a candidate feel genuinely seen or signals the quality of the organization they're about to join.</p>
      <p>Writing deeply personalized offer narratives for every candidate doesn't scale manually. But the candidate experience at the offer stage is exactly where effort pays off — it's the difference between a signed offer and a declined one.</p>

      <h2>What I built</h2>
      <p>A system that automatically generates personalized "offer ceremony" pages for every candidate who reaches the offer stage at Atlan. Each page tells a three-act story:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>"Who you are"</strong> — Synthesized from real interview feedback — what interviewers found impressive, the candidate's background, their strengths. Personal, specific, never generic.</li>
        <li><strong>"Why you belong at Atlan"</strong> — Maps the candidate's strengths to Atlan's values and the role's impact. Makes the case for fit in a way that's unique to them.</li>
        <li><strong>"Our offer"</strong> — The formal offer details, presented with context and warmth rather than cold numbers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The system triggers automatically when a candidate moves to the offer stage in our ATS. It pulls their full interview history, synthesizes the narrative with Claude, generates a premium web page, and notifies the TA team with a shareable link — all hands-free.</p>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Every candidate gets a personalized page</strong> — No manual writing, no bottleneck on the TA team, no "we'll get to it later"</li>
        <li><strong>Costs ~$0.006 per page</strong> — Effectively free at any hiring volume</li>
        <li><strong>Tone calibrates by seniority</strong> — A senior engineering hire gets a more intellectually dense narrative than an early-career hire</li>
        <li><strong>Print-ready</strong> — Designed to look as good on paper as on screen, so it can be used as a physical artifact too</li>
        <li><strong>Signals organizational quality</strong> — When a candidate receives a page like this, it tells them something about the kind of company Atlan is</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why it matters</h2>
      <p>Most TA teams are so focused on sourcing and interviewing that the offer experience gets neglected. This tool closes that gap — turning a transactional moment into a memorable one, at scale, with zero ongoing effort.</p>
