## The problem

Sourcing strategy begins with a question that most tools skip entirely: *where does this talent actually come from?* Job boards give you who's actively looking. LinkedIn gives you who exists. Neither tells you which companies to target, which non-obvious pools carry relevant experience, or which adjacent industries are worth a Boolean search.

That mapping usually happens in a recruiter's head, informally, before any search begins. It takes experience, domain knowledge, and an hour of desk research most teams don't have.

## What I built

Sourcing Compass is a one-page React app. You describe the role — title, seniority, company context, key skills, exclusions — and the AI returns four structured categories:

- **Target companies** — the most likely sources, with fit scores and tags
- **Adjacent talent pools** — consulting firms, research labs, adjacent verticals that carry transferable experience
- **Wildcard bets** — non-obvious, high-signal sources for when the standard pools are exhausted
- **Target titles** — exact and variant job titles with match confidence scores, ready to paste into a search

Nodes are connected. Hover any card and dashed lines show which companies map to which titles, which adjacent pools feed which targets. The entire result set is a graph, not a list.

## Why it matters

This replaces a specific and repeatable part of every sourcing kick-off: the landscape-mapping step that should happen before any Boolean search. It's fast enough to do live on a hiring manager call, specific enough to change actual search behaviour, and open enough that any recruiter can use it without a budget conversation.

The combination of zero backend (fully static, Groq API key in the browser), instant deployment via GitHub Pages, and a UI designed for recruiters rather than engineers makes it unusually low-friction to adopt.

## Signals

- Public product, live demo, full how-to README
- Covers a gap in the recruiting toolkit that most teams paper over with experience rather than tools
- Demonstrates that useful AI products for HR can be built fast, shipped free, and used immediately
